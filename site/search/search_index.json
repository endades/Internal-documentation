The purpose of the Internal Document is to align the technical team on the architecture, design decisions, implemented changes, and technical guidelines of the software throughout its lifecycle. Why is it important? Centralizes technical knowledge: Brings together key information about the internal workings of the system in one place, avoiding reliance on tacit knowledge. Facilitates software maintenance and evolution: Enables new developers or teams to quickly understand the codebase, technical decisions, and existing dependencies. Improves technical consistency: Helps maintain consistent development standards, design patterns, and best practices across modules and versions. Reduces risks and errors: Documenting decisions, assumptions, and limitations reduces errors caused by misaligned or misunderstood changes. Supports technical decision-making: Provides historical and technical context to evaluate refactoring efforts, new features, or architectural changes.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#what-is-an-internal-document-for","text":"The purpose of the Internal Document is to align the technical team on the architecture, design decisions, implemented changes, and technical guidelines of the software throughout its lifecycle.","title":"What is an internal document for?"},{"location":"#why-is-it-important","text":"Centralizes technical knowledge: Brings together key information about the internal workings of the system in one place, avoiding reliance on tacit knowledge.
