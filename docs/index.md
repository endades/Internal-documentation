# What is an internal document for?

The purpose of the Internal Document is to **align the technical team** on the architecture, design decisions, implemented changes, and technical guidelines of the software throughout its lifecycle.

---

# Why is it important?

- **Centralizes technical knowledge:**  
  Brings together key information about the internal workings of the system in one place, avoiding reliance on tacit knowledge.

- **Facilitates software maintenance and evolution:**  
  Enables new developers or teams to quickly understand the codebase, technical decisions, and existing dependencies.

- **Improves technical consistency:**  
  Helps maintain consistent development standards, design patterns, and best practices across modules and versions.

- **Reduces risks and errors:**  
  Documenting decisions, assumptions, and limitations reduces errors caused by misaligned or misunderstood changes.

- **Supports technical decision-making:**  
  Provides historical and technical context to evaluate refactoring efforts, new features, or architectural changes.
