Facilitates software maintenance and evolution: Enables new developers or teams to quickly understand the codebase, technical decisions, and existing dependencies. Improves technical consistency: Helps maintain consistent development standards, design patterns, and best practices across modules and versions. Reduces risks and errors: Documenting decisions, assumptions, and limitations reduces errors caused by misaligned or misunderstood changes. Supports technical decision-making: Provides historical and technical context to evaluate refactoring efforts, new features, or architectural changes.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#what-is-an-internal-document-for","text":"The purpose of the Internal Document is to align the technical team on the architecture, design decisions, implemented changes, and technical guidelines of the software throughout its lifecycle.","title":"What is an internal document for?"},{"location":"#why-is-it-important","text":"Centralizes technical knowledge: Brings together key information about the internal workings of the system in one place, avoiding reliance on tacit knowledge.
